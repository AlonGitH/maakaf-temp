# Welcome Dear Recruiters

**Maakaf** was created with the goal of strengthening the world of open-source in Israel, especially the opportunity to contribute to open-source projects.
Our emphasis is on making this unique field accessible to all.
Everyone is welcome to join the community regardless of religion, race, gender, or professional experience.

## Why Should You Recruit a Developer Who Contributes to Open Source?

- **Proven Knowledge -**  
A developer who has had code approved for open-source projects managed by experienced programmers demonstrates advanced programming skills and can directly present their skills through proven experience. Not only did the developer successfully write working code, but it was also approved by an experienced developer who vouched for the quality of their code.

- **High Communication Skills -**  
To succeed in contributing to open source, you need to have excellent communication skills. This is a developer who, independently, managed to coordinate remotely with the project manager and add their code to the project. Without high communication skills, this is impossible.

- **Initiative -**  
Only a developer who loves the profession, loves writing code, and is eager to contribute to open source. These are developers who don't wait for instructions to promote a project but rather are passionate programmers with a big vision who want to initiate and act, even when there are no immediate requirements.
