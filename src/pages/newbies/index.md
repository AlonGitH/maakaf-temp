Welcome to the "Maakaf" community!
### An open-source community in Israel üåê

**Join us on Discord:** <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.gg/WxqmcKfD5R">Click here</a>

#### Why Contribute to Open Source?

**Experienced Developers?** During your contribution to open source, experienced developers in various technologies will review the code you've written and provide valuable feedback, pushing you forward.

**Juniors?** In addition to learning and improving your skills, contributing to open source is the closest thing to real-world experience you can gain on your own. Code that you write and is accepted after a code review by a senior industry expert will significantly enhance your resume and demonstrate your high-level coding skills.

#### Why Join the Community?

**Introduce Yourself and Meet Others:** The community is based on personal connections. We would be happy if you share what you're looking for and your capabilities.

**Engage in Projects That Interest You:** The community projects are organized by different languages and technologies. You can easily find a project that interests you and use the technologies you love.

**Networking:** We encourage community members to share social networks (e.g., LinkedIn) to create new connections.

**Specialization:** Want to specialize in open source? We're here to help. We have dedicated channels for guidance and mentors who can assist you.

#### How to Contribute Code?

If you have never contributed to open source before, you can practice your first contribution with us (just add a text file to the project). We've created a [special project for you to make code contributions](https://github.com/UrielOfir/os-practice) to learn how to make code contributions on GitHub. There's also a [detailed guide that explains how to contribute to this project](https://github.com/UrielOfir/os-practice).
